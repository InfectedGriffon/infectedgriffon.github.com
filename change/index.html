		<h2>Preparing For Change</h2>
		<p>Since Covid-19 started right during my first year of high school, a lot of my time
		has been spent with online school. Some important things I can tell you though, are that
		instead of learning a bit of everything, you can pick which classes you want to do. The only
		requirement is the diploma, which has a list of classes you have to do to finish high school.
		Most of the requirements are basic classes like math and english, and some categories that you 
		need one of the classes from. You also need to get 40 hours of community service, but that's 
		pretty easy to do if you do a little bit every year.</p>
		<h2>Planning For the Future</h2>
		<p>Picking which classes you can do means that you need to think ahead for what career you want
		in the future, and which classes you would need as prerequesites. If you wanted to stay with 
		your friends, you would have to coordinate which classes you have with them. Or, you could just
		make your guidance councillor pick them all for you.</p>
