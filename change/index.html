		<h2>Preparing For Change</h2>
		<p>Since Covid-19 started right during my first year of high school, a lot of my time
		has been spent with online school. Some important things I can tell you though, are that
		instead of learning a bit of everything, you can pick which classes you want to do. The only
		requirement is the diploma, which has a list of classes you have to do to finish high school.
		Most of the requirements are basic classes like math and english, and some categories that you 
		need one of the classes from.</p>
